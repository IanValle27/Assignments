#### Highest Score

Language: Java   

This program uses 2 input files Hw03.java and the contest_.in files  
to use dynamic programming and determine the optimum problem list to tackle  
to gain the most points with the least amount of time having to fully solve the problems  

##### Requirements

* Compiling
  * Linux / Mac terminal with javac
  * Windows with bash and javac or an ide
* Files
  * Hw03.java
  * contest_.in

##### Compilation and Testing (Linux/Mac Command Line)

* Compile source file (.java files) at the command line:
  * javac Hw03.java
* By default, this will produce an executable file called Hw03.class, which you can run by typing:
  * java Hw03 contest_.in
* Redirect output from the screen to a .txt file:
  * java Hw03 contest_.in > output.txt
* Use diff to compare against the test cases
  * diff output.txt contest_.output  
If the files differ it will output information about the lines that aren't the same
